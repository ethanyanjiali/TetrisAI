TetrisAI is a online tetris game with an artificial inteligence agent. In this game, you will compete with the world level AI player. Note that in order to simplify the gameplay,
we removed the dropping animation of each piece. So it becomes more like a timed strategy game instead of an action game.

We used [particle swarm optimization](http://imake.ninja/el-tetris-an-improvement-on-pierre-dellacheries-algorithm/) algorithm to get the weight for each heuristic. And those heruistics are used for the AI to make decision of the next move.

To try it out, just go here and click "AI SHOW!", and you will have an idea about how it looks like:
